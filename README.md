## About
Project of smart RGB lamp controlled by iOS app using Bluetooth Low Energy. 

In addition to the usual color change, it also offers the option of setting an alarm for a specific time and a music mode that dynamically changes the color and brightness of the lamp depending on the song frequency and amplitude.

## Software
Our project consists of both STM32 application and iOS app.

## Hardware
1. STM32F407G-DISC1,
2. 2x8 LED WS2812b ring,
3. Bluetooth module 4.0 BLE - HM-10 - 3,3V/5V.

## Tools 
1. STM32CubeMX,
2. System Workbench for STM32,
3. ST-LinkUpgrade,
4. [WS2812b STM32 HAL Library](https://github.com/lamik/WS2812B_STM32_HAL) - adjusted to our needs,
5. Xcode.

## Requirements
- Swift 5.0,
- iOS 12.

## How to compile & run

#### iOS application:
- Clone project and sign it with your own certificate.
- Connect your iPhone and press `Run` button.

#### STM32F4 application:
- Clone and compile project to STM32F4 Discovery.
- Connect all pins correctly:
`USART6_RX` - `PC7`,
`USART6_TX` - `PC6`,
`SPI1_SCK` - `PA5`,
`SPI1_MOSI` - `PA7`.

Plug the power adapter into a power outlet. Connect with lamp by app and turn it on.
